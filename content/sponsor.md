## DevOps'ish Ad Format

Your ad will be featured *natively* in e-mails to all subcribers and on [devopsish.com](/). Additionally, I'd be happy to share your ad on social media. However, a limit of no more than three times per week on a schedule that fits the needs of advertiser(s) exists.

Ads include a bolded headline, additional copy, links as specified, and are followed by the italicized word, *SPONSORED*. This native format prevents ad blockers from blocking ads. It also eliminates a lot of headaches with regards to formatting. Total ad length including headline and *SPONSORED* tag should not exceed 280 characters.

[**DEVOPS NEWSLETTER**](/)

Every week I begin the newsletter with an personal message or introduction. Ads appear after this message. If another location in the newsletter fits better for your ad please let me know.
