DevOps'ish readers are a diverse group of people who care deeply about a wide range of technologies and the business practices pertinent to them. The audience includes people from Amazon, Apple, Google, Intel, Microsoft, Red Hat, and many other organizations.

Demographic data outside of what's shared on this page for DevOps'ish subscribers is not available.

The newsletter is sent every Sunday to a highly technical audience. There may be weeks where due to travel or timezone differences the newsletter is sent a day earlier or a day later but this is rare.

## Sponsorship Rates

For a one (1) week sponsorship period, the fixed fee is **$100 USD**. Sponsors purchasing four or more weeks at a time receive a 5% discount.

## Ad Format

Your ad will be featured *natively* in e-mails to all subcribers and devopsish.com. Additionally, I'd be happy to [Tweet](https://twitter.com/ChrisShort) your ad no more than three times per week on a schedule that fits the needs of advertiser(s).

Ads include a bolded headline, additional copy, links as specified, and are followed by the italicized word, *SPONSORED*. This native format prevents ad blockers from blocking ads. It also eliminates a lot of headaches with regards to formatting. Total ad length including headline and *SPONSORED* tag should not exceed 280 characters.

[**EXAMPLE AD**](/)  
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Etiam ut libero erat. Morbi convallis tempor facilisis. In vulputate hendrerit mollis. Suspendisse vitae massa aliquet, dignissim nibh quis, facilisis odio. Fusce sed consequat magna. *SPONSORED*

Every week I begin the newsletter with a personal message that I call the "monologue". Ads appear after this message. If another location in the newsletter fits better for your ad please let me know.
