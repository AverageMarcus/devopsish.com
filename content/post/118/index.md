Life is more significant than tech. We all recognize this fact but, seldom do we internalize it and own it. This newsletter attempts to imitate life. Injecting needed doses of humanity and thought provocation into your inbox every week. People, Process, and Tools involves all facets of each. They're in that order for a reason. I can load your inbox up every week with endless lists of tools. They aren't going to fix your broken processes though. The people implementing those processes need to have their minds open to new ideas and methods.

People implementing processes they have real ownership in using tooling they find real value in using will go further towards improving outcomes than implementing any new piece of technology ever will. My long-held opinion that technology should improve life is only a part of the equation. Technology by itself gives people a way to improve something. People do the actual improving. The care, education, and growth of the people in your charge are dependent upon you. Treat this great responsibility with the attention it deserves and you will go very far in life.
