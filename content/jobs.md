[DevOps Engineer at Solarwinds (Edinburgh, United Kingdom; Durham, NC)](https://solarwinds.jobs/edinburgh-gbr/devops-engineer/C65FA9564C424249B5832FF78FB34709/job/)  
The DevOps Engineer will play an important role in supporting the 24x7 availability and ongoing growth of our service offerings. The successful candidate will possess a high degree of technical skill, have a collaborative approach to problem solving, and understand the important of balancing operational decisions against total cost of ownership. We're a multi-office, multi-timezone team and so communication skills and self management are very important to us.

[Senior DevOps Engineer (NYC or US-based Remote)](https://www.olo.com/company/job.html?id=job_20180627210714_OLQWT2RCZWJFWNRR)  
At Olo we develop an online food ordering platform used by many of the country’s largest restaurant chains, reaching millions of consumers. Chances are if you’ve ordered directly from a restaurant brand’s app or website, we’ve made that happen. Mobile ordering and payments is an exciting and active industry full of interesting players and yet still a relatively untapped market ripe for disruption. We’re quite up-front about the technical challenges our business faces. Running a platform with multiple white-labeled front-ends, that maintains real-time connections into thousands of restaurants’ POS systems, and coordinates complex transactions between these and other third parties (such as payment gateways and gift card providers) is not for the faint of heart!
